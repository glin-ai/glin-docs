# GLIN Network

Welcome to GLIN Network - the blockchain infrastructure powering decentralized AI and federated learning.

## What is GLIN Network?

GLIN Network is a Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for federated learning and decentralized AI applications. It provides the infrastructure for:

- ðŸ¤– **Federated Learning** - Train AI models across distributed data
- ðŸ’° **Incentive Layer** - Reward contributors with GLIN tokens
- ðŸ”’ **Privacy-Preserving** - Keep data local, share only gradients
- âš¡ **High Performance** - Optimized for AI workloads

## Key Features

### Decentralized AI Training
Run machine learning tasks across a global network of providers without sharing raw data.

### Token Economy
GLIN tokens incentivize:
- Training providers who contribute compute
- Data providers who contribute datasets
- Validators who secure the network
- Aggregators who combine gradients

### Developer-Friendly
- REST API and WebSocket support
- TypeScript and Rust SDKs
- Smart contract support (ink!)
- Comprehensive tooling
