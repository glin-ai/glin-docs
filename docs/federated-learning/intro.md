# Federated Learning on GLIN

Train machine learning models across distributed data sources without sharing raw data.

## What is Federated Learning?

Federated Learning is a machine learning technique that trains models across decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging the raw data. GLIN Network provides the infrastructure to:

- 🤖 **Create Training Tasks** - Define models and requirements
- 💻 **Distributed Training** - Train across global providers
- 🔐 **Privacy-Preserving** - Data never leaves local devices
- 💰 **Incentivized** - Reward providers with GLIN tokens
- 🎯 **Decentralized** - No central authority required

## How It Works

```
1. Task Creator → Post training task on-chain
2. Providers → Download model, train on local data
3. Submit → Upload encrypted gradients to network
4. Aggregator → Combine gradients into global model
5. Rewards → Distribute GLIN tokens to contributors
```

## Use Cases

### Healthcare
Train models on medical data across hospitals without sharing patient records.

### Finance
Build fraud detection models using data from multiple banks while maintaining confidentiality.

### IoT & Edge Computing
Train models on device data (smartphones, sensors) without uploading raw data to cloud.

### Collaborative Research
Enable researchers to collaborate on ML models without sharing proprietary datasets.

## Quick Start

### Install the Client

```bash
npm install @glin-ai/federated
```

### Create Your First Task

```typescript
import { FederatedClient } from '@glin-ai/federated';

const client = await FederatedClient.connect();

const task = await client.createTask({
  name: 'Image Classifier',
  model: 'resnet50',
  rounds: 10,
  minProviders: 5,
  rewardPerRound: '100 GLIN'
});

console.log('Task created:', task.id);
```

## Architecture

- **Task Registry** - On-chain task definitions and status
- **Gradient Storage** - Encrypted gradient uploads
- **Aggregation** - Secure multi-party computation
- **Rewards** - Automatic token distribution
- **Verification** - Quality checks and fraud prevention
